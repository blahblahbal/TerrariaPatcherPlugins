# blahblahbal's TerrariaPatcher Plugins

This a collection (as of now, only one) of plugins for Transcend's TerrariaPatcher app.

Added support for two modes; Rare drops only, and everything is multiplied.

Code for 'everything' mode was written by Transcend.


DropRates.cs - Allows modification of drops.


Keys:
- P = Increase Drop Rate multiplier.
- O = Decrease Drop Rate multiplier.
- Right Ctrl = Toggle Rare Drops only

Maximum Drop Rate multiplier is 20; minimum is 1.
